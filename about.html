            If the sequence remains bounded, it is colored blue. Otherwise, it
            is coloured red.
          </p>
          <p>
            A sequence is considered <span class="b">bounded</span> when the
            terms never leave the area near the origin, either becauase they
            converge to a single value, or because they oscillate between two or
            more vaulues (example above where <code>c = i</code> or in image
            below where <code>c = -0.361 + 0.146i</code>)
          </p>
          <figure class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="./assets/converges1.png" />
            <figcaption>
              The sequence remains bounded in an area around the origin.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Otherwise, if the terms "explode" to higher and higher values we
            consider it
            <span class="b">divergent</span> (example above where
            <code>c = 1</code> or below where <code>c = -0.683 + 0.307i</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is sometimes easy to tell when the graph diverges. Once any term
            in the sequence passes the "point of no return" (which is when the
            pythagorean distance is more than <code>2</code> units away from the
            origin), it can be demonstrated mathematically that the sequence can
            never start getting smaller again.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in other cases, it is less clear whether a c-value point
            will remain bounded or will eventually diverge. For some c-values,
            the sequence will "bounce around" the origin hundreds of times
            before eventually passing the point of no return. In other cases, it
            can bounce around orders of magnitude many more times before leaving
            the bounded zone. It is not always computationally possible to
            calculate so many iterations of the seqeunce.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, this plot logic uses a threshold value of 150. If the
            sequence has not diverged after 150 iterations, we assume it is
            bounded.

            The natural question one might ask is
            <span class="b"
              >for which region on the graph is the sequence bounded, and which
              not?</span

            Mathemtician Benoit Mandelbrot had the same question, and set his
            computer at work, and came back to surprising results. The answer
            was more fascinating than he expected. Today we call the set of
            points c for which the sequence remainded bounded the
            <span class="b"> Mandelbrot set</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mandelbrot set is illustrated below, with the black regions
            representing the Mandelbrot set, and the colored regions
            representing outside the Mandelbrot set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas we might have expected a simply shaped region with a sharp,
            well-defined border, we instead get a beautifully complex shape with
            an infinitely detailed border; however much you "zoom in" with your
            decimal precision doing the calculations, the shape will never
            become smooth, it remains complex at any scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example: <code>c = i</code> remains bounded, but
            <code>c = 1.00001i</code> will diverge after a dozen or so
            iterations.

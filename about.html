              A sequence is considered <span class="b">bounded</span> when the
              terms never leave the area near the origin, either becauase they
              converge to a single value, or because they oscillate between two
              or more vaulues (example above where <code>c = i</code> or in
              image below where <code>c = -0.361 + 0.146i</code>)
            </p>

              <figcaption>
                The sequence remains bounded in an area around the origin.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if the terms "explode" to higher and higher values we
              consider it
              <span class="b">divergent</span> (example above where
              <code>c = 1</code> or below where
              <code>c = -0.683 + 0.307i</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
              It is sometimes easy to tell when the graph diverges. Once any
              term in the sequence passes the "point of no return" (which is
              when the pythagorean distance is more than <code>2</code> units
              away from the origin), it can be demonstrated mathematically that
              the sequence can never start getting smaller again.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, in other cases, it is less clear whether a c-value point
              will remain bounded or will eventually diverge. For some c-values,
              the sequence will "bounce around" the origin hundreds of times
              before eventually passing the point of no return. In other cases,
              it can bounce around orders of magnitude many more times before
              leaving the bounded zone. It is not always computationally
              possible to calculate so many iterations of the seqeunce.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence, this plot logic uses a threshold value of 150. If the
              sequence has not diverged after 150 iterations, we assume it is
              bounded.

              Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot had the same question, and set his
              computer at work, and came back to surprising results. The answer
              was more fascinating than he expected. Today we call the set of
              points c for which the sequence remainded bounded the
              <span class="b"> Mandelbrot set</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Mandelbrot set is illustrated below, with the black regions
              representing points <span class="i">in</span> the set, and colored
              regions representing points <span class="i">outside</span> the
              set. (The specific coloring below is arbitrary, but correlates to
              how many iterations of the sequence before the point is known to
              diverge.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Whereas we might have expected a simply shaped region with a
              sharp, well-defined border, what was instead discovered was a
              beautifully complex shape with an infinitely detailed border;
              however much you "zoom in" with your decimal precision doing the
              calculations, the shape will never become smooth, it remains
              complex at any scale. This type of shape is called a
              <span class="b">fractal</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example: <code>c = i</code> remains bounded, but
              <code>c = 1.00001i</code> will diverge after a dozen or so
              iterations.
